[code example](https://godbolt.org/z/Mja1PjaKT):
```
#include <utility>

int main() {
  int a = 5;
  auto l = [&r = std::move(std::as_const(a))] {
    return r;
  };
}
```

The two major compilers disagree about a specific piece of code.
GCC gives an error, while Clang accepts this code example.

Let's analyze according to the standard.

[expr.prim.lambda.capture] 6: "An init-capture inhabits the lambda scope ([basic.scope.lambda]) of the lambda-expression. An init-capture without ellipsis behaves as if it declares and explicitly captures a variable of the form “auto init-capture ;”, <...> "

So it is just ```auto &r = std::move(std::as_const(a))```, valid statement (r is const int &)

GCC has bug, GCC is wrong, Clang is right.

Also we could find this bug on GCC bugzilla: [bug 87638](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=87638)
