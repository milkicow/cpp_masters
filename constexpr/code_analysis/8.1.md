[code example](https://godbolt.org/z/ncnM6Kd94):
```
struct S {
  int : *new int{0};
};

enum E {
  V = *new int{1},
};
```

First, let's analyze struct S, according to [class.bit] 1:

"The constant-expression shall be an **integral constant expression** with a value greater than or equal to zero and is called the width of the bit-field."

And for enum E [dcl.enum]:

"If an initializer is specified for an enumerator, the constant-expression shall be an **integral constant expression**."

[expr.const] 19:

An **integral constant expression** is an expression of integral or unscoped enumeration type, implicitly converted to a prvalue, where the converted expression **is a core constant expression**.

But it is not core constant because [expr.const] 10:

"An expression E is a core constant expression unless the evaluation of E, following the rules of the abstract machine ([intro.execution]), would evaluate one of the following:"

<...>

[expr.const] 10.18

a new-expression ([expr.new]), unless either

(10.18.1)
the selected allocation function is a replaceable global allocation function ([new.delete.single], [new.delete.array]) and **the allocated storage is deallocated** within the evaluation of E

But it is not, so it should be error: GCC is right, Clang is wrong
